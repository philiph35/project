# In order to run my project, the file path for the 'healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv' file may need to be updated in the program in order to read in the csv file. 
# This csv file is provided in the zip folder with the python file, but depending on the method/IDE used for running the program, the local path to the csv file may need to be set.
# Once the data from the csv is successfully loaded, the rest of the program will run the logistic regression and support-vector machine models.
# They will both print out their F1-score and confusion matrix. 
# The models are then revised with feature selection, fit and tested again, and the new performance metrics will print out.
